Switchable Seats is a tool that allows you to expand and simplify the use of seats. With it you can:/n
*Assign shortkeys (right now only from 1 to 9) to seats so you could switch between them without leaving the vehicle./n
*Create "doors" from props - click USE on them and you will be instantly transfered to seat with lowest shortkey (if it's occupied it will move you to next chair with higher number)/n
*Create exit point - no more being stuck in vehicle after leaving it./n
