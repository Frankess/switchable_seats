Switchable Seats is a tool that allows you to expand and simplify the use of seats. With it you can:<br>
*Assign shortkeys (right now only from 1 to 9) to seats so you could switch between them without leaving the vehicle.<br>
*Create "doors" from props - click USE on them and you will be instantly transfered to seat with lowest shortkey (if it's occupied it will move you to next chair with higher number).<br>
*Create exit point - no more being stuck in vehicle after leaving it.<br>
<br>
Usage:<br>
First select vehicle using <b>E</b> + <b>Left Mouse Button</b><br>
Then select a seat with <b>Left Mouse Button</b> and in content menu assign shortkey.<br>
If you want to add door to the vehicle select prop(s) with <b>Shifht</b> + <b>Left Mouse Button</b><br>
You can also add exit point by clicking button content menu<br>
After all is set use <b>Right Mouse Button</b> to accept changes<br>
There is also <b>R</b> for deleting all settings
<b>REMEMBER!</b> If you aren't making any changes in seat configuration but you selected the vehilce save it with <b>RMB</b> or all changes are gonna be lost!<b>
